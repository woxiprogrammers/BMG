        <h2>Privacy Policy Statement for the BMG Website</h2>
        <p> Welcome to the website of BMG which BMG Rights Management GmbH, Germany, 
          ("BMG", "we", "us", "our") operates on behalf of all members of the BMG group of companies. Protecting our users' 
          personal data is an important concern for BMG. All of BMG's activities on and in connection with this website 
          ("our website") comply with the applicable data protection legislation. <br>
          This privacy policy informs you on how and for what purpose we process personal data in connection with your
          visit to, and use of, our website. Any changes that we make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted
          on this page. </p>
        <h2 style="text-align:left;">A. Collection and Processing of Personal Data </h2>
        <p> We collect and process personal data, i.e. information that identifies, or at least 
          makes it possible to identify, you as a natural person (e.g. your name, your address and/or e-mail address) when you 
          decide to actively communicate with us, when you subscribe to services we may provide, and when you use our online client 
          platform (the "Platform") as a writer, publisher or other contracting partner of BMG (jointly "BMG Partner(s)") in the 
          "my.bmg" section of our website (see sections A.1 and A.2 below). Furthermore, we collect and process certain technical 
          data that results from you visiting our website (see section B below). </p>
        <h4><span>1. The Public Section of the Website </span></h4>
        <p> <b>There are certain data that you may - but by no means must - submit to us when using the public parts 
          of our website.</b><br>
        </p>
        <p><span class="span1"> 1.1</span> When you subscribe to services that 
          we may offer our users from time to time you will obviously have to submit your email address as well as any 
          other data necessary for the provision of the service. Also, there are means on our website to get in touch 
          with us directly, especially our contact form, which in turn requires you to submit personal data, such as your 
          name and email address, but also the very content of your request.<br>
        </p>
        <p><span class="span1"> 1.2</span> We collect, store and use such data in order to fulfil your 
          corresponding request. Your data will not be collected, stored or used in any other way or for any other 
          purpose. Hence, as an example, if you submit your email address via our contact form with a request for 
          certain information, we will use only your email address to get back to you with - so we hope - the information 
          you requested. Hence, you fully control the information you provide BMG about yourself and how it may be used. <br>
        </p>
        <h4><span>2. Our Online Client Platform </span></h4>
        <p> The Platform under "my.bmg.com" is a service for BMG Partners 
          who wish to stay fully informed and up to date on their royalty earnings. For BMG Partners we provide an online
          interface to our corresponding databases. </p>
        <p><span class="span1"> 2.1</span> To ensure that only you as a BMG Partner may gain access to the corresponding information we conduct an offline  
          registration process. If you have decided to get in touch with the designated contact person and have 
          received your login data, you may login to your account on the Platform. <br>
        </p>
        <p><span class="span1"> 2.2</span> You are not required to submit any extra personal data before or while using
          the Platform (see section 2.3, though). Please, be aware, however, that the data you can retrieve on the Platform is 
          personal and confidential. If you pass on your login data to anyone else, or if it gets passed on to anyone else, 
          that person can access the data just as you can, unless and until you tell us to block your login data.<br>
        </p>
        <p><span class="span1"> 2.3</span> While not being required to submit personal data through the Platform, 
          you can edit certain personal data in the "Settings" section of the Platform. We will store and use edited personal 
          data to, as applicable, continue providing the services of the Platform for you and/or to fulfil our obligations 
          towards you. For example, by informing us of a new postal address, you allow us to send you any statements or 
          other documents we may owe you to that address, unless stipulated otherwise in your contractual documentation. </p>
        <h3 class="h3Style">B. Log Files, Cookies, Web Analytics and Social Media Plugins </h3>
        <h4><span>1. General and Error Log Files </span></h4>
        <p>When you visit our website, our webservers store certain
          data in log files.</p>
        <p><span class="span1"> 1.1</span> The general log files may 
          tell us which Internet browser and operating system you were using and which (masked) IP address was allocated to your
          Internet access when you were visiting the site, the URL of the internet page from which you arrived at our website, 
          the exact time when you accessed and left our website, the amount of data transmitted, and the pages you accessed on 
          our website. The last octet (8-bit byte) of the IP address in the general log files will be masked, thereby restricting
          our (or a third party's) ability to connect the IP address to your specific Internet access. <br>
        </p>
        <p><span class="span1"> 1.2</span> Should our web server(s) detect an error in processing requests, 
          it will send the corresponding information to an error log file. Those log files for technical reasons also record
          the client IP address from which the request was sent, i.e. your IP address if your request caused the error. <br>
        </p>
        <p><span class="span1"> 1.3</span> We have no means, and no interest in, identifying you through the general
          or error log file data. We use the general log file data for statistical purposes. The information we can from time 
          to time retrieve from the files relates to, for example, peak times of the use of our website, which information our 
          users are most interested in on the website, how users navigate on our website and which browsers and operating system 
          our users use. We use that information to improve the technical setup as well as the design of our website. The error log 
          files are used to diagnose and fix the error. </p>
        <h4><span>2. Platform Log Files </span></h4>
        <p>In addition to the general and error log files, we keep log 
          files of all logins to and logouts from, and downloads of documents from, the Platform under my.bmg.com in order to 
          protect you and ourselves from any misuse of the service. For that purpose, we also display the exact time and date of 
          your latest login in the "Settings" section of your account on the Platform, which we store in our database. <br>
        </p>
        <h4><span>3. Cookies </span></h4>
        <p><span class="span1"> 3.1</span> Our website uses http cookies. An http cookie is a piece of text stored 
          on your computer by your web browser. Cookies are sent as a field in the header of the http response by our web server(s).
          It is then sent back by your browser every time it accesses the respective web server. <br>
        </p>
        <p><span>•</span>Our website uses session and persistent cookies in order to provide you with an easy and comfortable web service. 
          They allow us to, for example, display the German contact information any time you visit our website if your first
          visit to the site came from Germany. <br>
          <span class="cookiesDotPoints">•</span>The Platform under my.bmg.com uses session cookies (which are automatically deleted at the end of each session) 
          that, for example, allow us to identify you as the same user (but no more) over a session on our website and to "keep" 
          certain data across more than one webpage so that you don't have to reinsert the same data or set your personal settings 
          over and over again. Also, my.bmg.com sets a persistent cookie to keep the particular language that you prefer so that you
          can use the Platform in that language without having to change your settings each time you access the Platform.<br>
        </p>
        <p><span class="span1"> 3.2</span> Should you, however, wish to generally discontinue the use of cookies, you may 
          use your browser settings to prevent the acceptance and storage of new cookies. To find out how this works with your 
          browser, resort to the browser's help function or contact the manufacturer. However, we recommend leaving the cookies 
          functions switched on as, only if you do, will you retain the full benefit of the high level of user comfort to which 
          we strive. In addition, the use of the Platform requires us to be able to set cookies. </p>
        <h4><span>4. Web Analytics </span></h4>
        <p>Our website may use Google Analytics. Google Analytics is a web 
          analytics service provided by Google, Inc., of Mountain View, CA 94043, U.S.A. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses 
          cookies (cf. section 3 above) that enable an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the 
          cookie about your use of our website (such as when you visited the website, the referrer URL, details on the 
          configuration of your operating system, your browser and your access provider) are generally transmitted to, and 
          stored on, a server of Google located in the U.S.A. As we are using Google Analytics' "_anonymizeIp()" function, 
          your IP address will be shortened within members states of the European Union or in other states of the European 
          Economic Area. It is only in exceptional circumstances that your IP address is transmitted to the U.S.A. and shortened 
          there. Google will use the information on our behalf to analyze your use of the website, to compile reports on website 
          activity, and to provide us with additional services related to the use of the website as well as Internet use. The IP 
          address collected within the framework of Google Analytics will not be combined with other Google data.<br>
        </p>
        <p> You will find further information on Google and Google Analytics at http://www.google.com, and Google's Privacy Policy 
          at <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/">http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/">http://www.google.com/intl/de/privacypolicy.html#information.</a><br>
          As already explained above, you can use your browser settings to prevent the acceptance and storage of new cookies. 
          Should you disagree with the analysis of your use of our website you can also deactivate Google Analytics and thus 
          declare your objection to the collection and processing of the respective data. To do this, please download and install 
          the browser plugin that Google provides for this purpose. The plugin is available at 
          http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en]. <br>
        </p>
        <p> Once the plugin has been installed, it will prevent the recollection of the data related to your use of our website 
          that has been generated by the cookie (including your IP address). <br>
        </p>
        <h4><span>5. Social Media Plugins </span></h4>
        <p>On certain webpages of our website we may implement 
          so-called social media plugins, in particular Facebook, Inc.'s "like" button, Google's "+1" button and
          Twitter, Inc.'s Twitter buttons. When you visit a page that displays one or more of such buttons your 
          browser will establish a direct connection to the respective Facebook, Google and/or Twitter server and 
          load the button from there. At the same time Facebook, Google and/or Twitter will know that the respective 
          page on our website has been visited. <br>
        </p>
        <p> We have no influence on the data that Facebook, Google and Twitter collect on the basis of the buttons. 
          According to the available information, however, if you do not click on the respective buttons no personal 
          data will be collected and stored unless you have logged onto to your Facebook, Google or Twitter account. 
          In that case certain user data (including your IP address at the time) may be collected and linked to the 
          account information already present at Facebook, Google or Twitter, respectively. If you wish to prevent this,
          please log out of your social media accounts before visiting our website. <br>
        </p>
        <p> In addition, clicking a button may also lead to a collection of certain data, such as the user's IP address. 
          Facebook, Google or Twitter may set cookies as well, unless you have disabled the acceptance and storage of 
          cookies in your browser settings (see above). <br>
        </p>
        <p> We receive no information from Facebook, Google or Twitter about which social media buttons you may have clicked 
          or seen on our website, but, if at all, we may receive a summarized, non-person-related statistical report on the 
          use of the buttons. <br>
        </p>

        <p>We will not disclose your personal data, be it by transmission or
          otherwise, to third parties except where: <br>
        </p>
        <ul >
          <li>such disclosure is necessary to fulfill existing obligations towards, or assert and enforce claims against, you; </li>
          <li>federal or competent state authorities, in particular law enforcement and/or data protection supervisory agencies, 
            request such disclosure on the basis of the applicable laws, if and inasmuch as such disclosure is necessary to
            counter dangers to public safety and order or for the investigation and persecution of criminal acts </li>
          <li>in the event that BMG acquires or merges with another company, sells assets, reorganizes or enters into a joint 
            venture or other business combination with another company, disclosure may be made to that other company; </li>
          <li> we are otherwise bound to do so by law. </li>

        <h4><span>D. Security </span></h4>
        <p>BMG takes great care to ensure the security of personal data. Your data is

          access or unauthorized disclosure through appropriate technical measures. <br>
        </p>
        <p> However, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee 
          that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, 
          will be safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. <br>
        </p>

        <h4><span>E. Third Party Sites </span></h4>
        <p>Third party sites linked to from this website may have different privacy policies
