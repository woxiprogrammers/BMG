        <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><span class="redText" style="font-size: 12px;">for BMG’s Online Client Platform at
          (my.bmg.com)</span> </p>
        <p> Welcome to the Online Client Platform of BMG (the “Platform”) at
          my.bmg.com (the “Site”), which BMG Rights Management GmbH, Germany,
          operates on behalf of itself and the BMG group of companies,
          including its affiliates and subsidiaries, (individually and
          collectively “ BMG”, “we”, “us”, “our”) for use by songwriters,
          publishers and other BMG clients (collectively, “BMG Client(s)”).<br>
          <br>
          THESE TERMS OF USE CONSTITUTE A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN
          BMG AND YOU, INDIVIDUALLY AS A BMG CLIENT, AND, IF YOU ARE ACCESSING
          OR USING THE PLATFORM OR THE SITE ON BEHALF OF A BMG CLIENT WITHIN
          THE SCOPE OF YOUR ENGAGEMENT OR RETENTION WITH THAT BMG CLIENT,
          BETWEEN BMG AND SUCH BMG CLIENT, AS A USER OF THE PLATFORM AND SITE
          (THE OR THESE “TERMS OF USE”). YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU
          ARE AUTHORIZED TO BIND YOURSELF AND SUCH BMG CLIENT AS A CONTRACTING
          PARTY TO THESE TERMS OF USE. UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED IN THESE
          TERMS OF USE, THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF THESE TERMS OF USE, THE
          WORDS “YOU” OR “YOUR” SHALL BE DEEMED TO REFER INDIVIDUALLY AND
          COLLECTIVELY TO YOU AND, IF APPLICABLE, THE BMG CLIENT ON WHOSE
          BEHALF YOU ARE ACCESSING OR USING THE PLATFORM OR THE SITE. <br>
          <br>
          BY REGISTERING, ACCESSING, BROWSING OR USING THE PLATFORM
          OR THE SITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD AND
          AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE, INCLUDING ANY CHANGES MADE
          HERETO THAT EXIST WHEN YOU RE-ACCESS THE PLATFORM OR THE SITE. WE
          MAY UPDATE THESE TERMS OF USE FROM TIME TO TIME WITHOUT NOTICE.
          UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED, SUCH CHANGES WILL BE EFFECTIVE WHEN THEY
          ARE POSTED. <br>
          <br>
          IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS OF USE OR ANY
          GUIDELINES, POLICIES OR RULES POSTED ON THE SITE, THEN DO NOT USE
          THE PLATFORM OR THE SITE. </p>
        <h4 class="textBold">1.Scope of Application</h4>
        <p> There are certain data that you may - but by no means must - submit to us when using the public parts 
          of our website.<br>
        </p>
        <h4 class="textBold">2.Login Credentials</h4>
        <p> <span class="redText subpoints"> 2.1</span> Using the Platform is an
          option for BMG Clients. We, therefore, do not simply send all BMG
          Clients user names and passwords (“ Login Credentials”), but rather
          ask BMG Clients whether they want us to generate Login Credentials
          because they have decided that using the Platform is something that
          they are interested in. If you have asked us to generate Login
          Credentials for you, we will do so and send the Login Credentials to
          you.<br>
        </p>
        <p> <span class="redText subpoints"> 2.2</span> It is your responsibility
          to keep the Login Credentials, especially your password, secret at
          all times and you are solely responsible to BMG for all activity
          that occurs via your account for the Platform and Site. If you lose
          the Login Credentials, or if you discover or suspect that your Login
          Credentials are being used by a third party, then you must
          immediately notify us to this effect. We will then block further use
          of the Login Credentials. Your Login Credentials should not be
          shared and you will remain fully responsible for the use of your
          account on the Platform any and all activities that occur under your
          account or as a result of your access to the Platform or the Site.
          BMG may require that you change your Login Credentials or certain
          parts of your account information at any time for any reason. In the
          event that your entity requires additional Login Credentials for
          other users, please contact BMG via email at my.bmg@bmg.com. <br>
        </p>
        <h4 class="textBold">3.Your Settings</h4>
        <p>In the “My Settings” section of the
          Platform we may allow you to edit certain data about yourself, such
          as your postal address. If you do so, we will, thereafter, use the
          edited data to communicate with you, including all communications
          made in connection with Contractual Documents (as defined below in
          section 4.1). The statements we send you by regular mail, will, for
          example, thereafter, only be sent to the new address. We are not
          liable for misdirected communications that result from your edits.</p>
        <h4 class="textBold">4.Accuracy of License and Royalty Data</h4>
        <p><span class="redText subpoints"> 4.1</span> In the “My Settings” section of the
          Platform we may allow you to edit certain data about yourself, such
          as your postal address. If you do so, we will, thereafter, use the
          edited data to communicate with you, including all communications
          made in connection with Contractual Documents (as defined below in
          section 4.1). The statements we send you by regular mail, will, for
          example, thereafter, only be sent to the new address. We are not
          liable for misdirected communications that result from your edits.</p>
        <p><span class="redText subpoints"> 4.2</span> No guarantee, statement,
          warranty or representation is given or made, nor is any liability
          whatsoever assumed by BMG, either explicitly or implicitly,
          regarding the reasonableness, correctness, accuracy or completeness
          of any song, license, royalty data, royalty statement or other data,
          information, materials or documents you may access, view, download
          or retrieve on the Platform.</p>
        <h4 class="textBold">5.Industrial and Intellectual Property Rights; Use of the Platform</h4>
        <p><span class="redText subpoints"> 5.1</span> The services on our
          Platform are, amongst other things, based on a database. This

          protected by copyright, trademark rights and/or any other

          transmit, distribute or make publicly available any Intellectual
          Property to third parties, without the prior written consent of BMG.<br>
        </p>
        <p><span class="redText subpoints"> 5.2</span> The contents of the
          Platform and Site may only be used for your personal informational
          purposes. Except as expressly provided in these Terms of Use, no
          part of the Platform or Site and no content may be copied,
          reproduced, republished, uploaded, posted, publicly displayed,
          encoded, translated, transmitted or distributed in any way
          (including "mirroring") to any other computer, server, website or
          other medium for publication or distribution or for any commercial
          enterprise, without BMG’s prior written consent.<br>
        </p>
        <p><span class="redText subpoints"> 5.3</span> You must not attempt to
          gain unauthorized access to any portion or feature of the Platform
          or the Site, or any other systems or networks connected to the Site
          or to any BMG server, or to any of the services offered on or
          through the Platform or the Site, by hacking, password “mining” or
          any other illegitimate or illegal means. Without limitation, you
          must not use the Platform or the Site to access or attempt to access
          data provided by any other BMG Client or use the Platform or the
          Site to violate the rights of any other BMG Client or other third
          party. <br>
        </p>
        <p><span class="redText subpoints"> 5.4</span> You must not forge headers
          or otherwise manipulate identifiers in order to disguise the origin
          of any message or transmittal you send to BMG on or through the
          Platform or the Site or any service offered on or through the
          Platform or the Site. You must not pretend that you are, or that you
